                    <p class="mbr-section-lead lead">Here are seven of the most-asked questions about the afterlife I get at my live events, live broadcasts or at book signings. The goal of this article is to show you that Love Never Dies and that your loved ones are alive and well on the other side.<br><br>1. Your loved ones are alive and well in the afterlife<br>Yes, it's true that our physical bodies do expire/die. But our souls are eternal. Your deceased loved ones are very much alive and on the other side – heaven, if you will.<br><br>You cannot die no matter how hard you try. Once you leave this body that we are born into, we return to heaven to meet up with our loved ones in the afterlife who have gone before us.<br><br>Over the past 30 years, I've literally brought back tens of thousands of specific, explicit messages from deceased loved ones. There's simply too much proof that they exist on the other side to deny it.<br><br>Love never dies.<br><br>2. Your loved ones are NOT in pain<br>One of biggest hurdles that people struggle with is the last memory we have of our loved ones. Especially those who have suffered greatly with a terrible disease.<br><br>I have good news for you. Once you leave your body, you are no longer in any pain.<br><br>Unfortunately, we tend to remember how our loved ones died, rather than how they lived.<br><br>Your deceased loved ones – if they suffered – are no longer in pain.<br><br>Here's a humorous example from a recent live event: I brought through a Dad who immediately showed me he was doing a funny dance. The young lady burst into tears saying it couldn't be him, his legs were amputated!<br><br>But here's the thing: his physical legs were amputated, yes. And he suffered before passing. But on the other side, we are returned back to the “image of God” and restored.<br><br>Dad was dancing to show his daughter he was alive and well in the afterlife. Hilariously, she admitted that when he was well, he danced silly at her wedding and it was a memory she'll always remember.<br><br>See? It's the happy memories they want us to remember!<br><br>3. Your loved ones don't miss you!<br>This often shocks people. Your deceased loved ones DO NOT miss you.<br><br>How can they? They aren't “dead.”<br><br>Your deceased loved ones are very much alive in spirit.<br><br>They are still loving and very interested in the goings-on of your life.<br><br>Yes, my friend, they are very much alive. They can see and hear you and they know what is going on in your life. They don't miss you because… they are still here, just in spirit.<br><br>How much can they see? Well…<br><br>4. They see everything in the afterlife! Everything…<br>I'm often asked, “Hey Blair, do they see… everything?”<br><br>Bad news: yes, they see EVERYTHING. Yes, they can see you naked in the shower.<br><br>One lady told me that after her Mother had passed she refused to have sex with her husband because she didn't want her Mom to see! (I'm not joking).<br><br>Yes, they can see everything. However, they are free from their bodies and very much evolved and enlightened. They no longer care about the material or the physical in that specific way.<br><br>Please, have showers and take baths. Your deceased loved ones don't care, and your friends and family will appreciate it.<br><br>5. They can hear you in the afterlife<br>This is a BIG ONE. As a medium, I'm often asked a variation of “Please tell my ______ I love her.”<br><br>You don't need a medium to do so. Your deceased loved ones can hear you perfectly fine. I repeat you do not need a medium to talk to them.<br><br>I'd highly recommend trying out my T.A.L.K. method from my book Afterlife. It works well.<br><br>6. They are sending you signs and want to connect with you.<br>Here's a comment I get a lot: “My ______ never sends me signs.”<br><br>I'm sure that people are sincere and believe that when they say it. But it is absolutely not true. Not at all.<br><br>Your deceased loved ones send you signs on a regular basis. No, not every single day, but often enough to encourage us.<br><br>So, the problem isn't with the signs. The problem is RECOGNIZING them.<br><br>In some ways, it's like a language. If you don't know the meanings of the words, how will you understand what they are saying?<br><br>Thankfully, recognizing the signs is easy: you need to know what the five signs are and you need to be open to experiencing them.<br><br>7. You won't burn in hell for experiencing love.<br>Unfortunately, religious dogma has messed up a lot of people and guilted them into believing that connecting with deceased loved ones is evil. Or that you'll burn in hell if you do speak with them.<br><br>Nothing could be further from the truth. In the Holy Bible, Jesus spoke with both Moses and Elijah who were deceased at the time. If Jesus could talk to the dead with his Father's blessing, it certainly is okay for you to as well.<br><br>The confusion comes from religions and religious texts being man-made. They are filled with conflicts and errors.<br><br>Of course, you are welcome to believe what you wish. By all means, live the rest of your days sad and lonely. It's certainly a choice, but it is not of God. And honestly, I feel sorry for people guilted by this flawed dogma. I hope and pray you are not one of them.<br><br>I hope this helps you. Love and light to you.<br><br></p>
